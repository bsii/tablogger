Tab Logger
==========


Description
-----------

'Tab Logger' is a chrome extension that allows users to keep track of their open tabs and collect statistics that help them incrementing their productivity. Besides, provides two functionalities that allow to optimize the usage of tabs. First, it allows to save memory resources by suspending tabs that have been inactive for long time in the background. This is a similar functionality to the one provided by existing extensions such as "The Great Suspender". Second, it provides users with a shortcut to close all tabs except the active one, which might be useful in case the browser is responding slowly.

Besides obtaining benefits on their productivity, users can contribute to research on computer security by sending statistics about their tab usage. Previous studies on the usage of tabs are few and limited by the small amount of participants and the methodology used for the collection of statistics. Even though the usage of tabs is not yet well understood, it is hypothesized that a specific behaviour might help protecting the user against security attacks.

Statistics Collection
---------------------

The extension collects the following attributes:

* Tab ID (https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs#type-Tab): an identifier of the tab where the event has originated.

* Event name: we collect the events 'onCreated', a new tab has been created; 'onRemoved' (a tab has been closed); 'onUpdated', a tab has been updated with a new URL; 'onLoaded', the page of the tab has finished loading.

* Time between the current event and the previous one.

The URL is not collected in any case and all the data above is stored in the HTML5 local storage associated to the extension.

These data are encrypted and sent to a database in central web server via HTTPS.
