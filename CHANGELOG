version 3.0

* Flag events that originate in background tabs such as tabs used for prerendering pages.
* Record 'onReplaced' events. A tab is replaced if it was prerendered in the background and then brought to the front (user clicked the prerendered link).
* Change encoding of events to optimize bandwidth use.
* Send instance version in the HTTP POST to distinguish new data from previous instances.
* Add new table in database to store new data and keep isolated from old data.
* Modify parsing function to be backward compatible with the old data format (no prerender awareness).
* Add test in Python to drive Chrome with Selenium's chromedriver and test the extension's response to prerendering.
